                    <p>I love baking. I love watching baking competition shows, buying baking cookbooks, and, of course, I love the act of actually baking. My fondness for baking began in 6th grade after I watched a Buzzfeed YouTube video titled “The Best Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies.”  Immediately after seeing it, I decided that I had to try making the cookies. How hard could it be? The answer to that question: Very, very hard. The whole process was a complete mess, and by the end of it the kitchen looked less like a kitchen and more like a high school movie cafeteria after a food fight. Despite this, the cookies tasted amazing, and thus began my now four-year-long baking obsession. I’ve tried it all, from layer cakes to macarons (which have failed too many times to count). My favorite thing to bake is undoubtedly layer cakes. I adore every minute of the often extremely long process, and I love decorating them, even though I’m not the best at it. This adoration began this February, when I purchased Claire Saffitz’s recipe book: “Dessert Person”. This is most definitely my favorite recipe book. I’ve made nearly half of the 105 recipes, and I plan on continuing to make the rest for a long time. Another recipe book that I love is Magnolia Bakery’s “The Complete Magnolia Bakery Cookbook.” This book is great for more simple recipes such as cookies, cheesecakes, and brownies, and is definitely fit for a beginning baker.</p>

                    <p>My first favorite hobby is making crafts. I don't just do crafts whenever I am bored, I do them whenever I feel like it. I do different types of things like pots, fake flowers, pillows, and whatever I think it's cute and that matches with my room. The reason I do this is because I like to do art, not like drawing but crafts. My mom and my sister kind of inspired me to do this because they were always creative with all kinds of stuff. My sister was creative with drawing and decorating stuff (she was kind of fashionable). My mom was always creative in everything; she even helped with both of my sisters to decorate a little bit more on my both sister’s quinceañeras. So that’s my number one thing I like to do as a hobby, making crafts.</p>
