      <h2>Welcome to My Hometown!</h2>
      <p>I was born in this city which was then known as Rangoon and lived there for 32 years. Since then I have lived abroad in several different countries, but still consider Rangoon to be my hometown. It is now officially known as Yangon, meaning "end of strife." Actually, Yangon is the original name in Burmese. When the country became a British colony the British rulers anglicized it to Rangoon, although the people always referred to it by its original name.

        When I was growing up in Rangoon, the population of the city was barely half a million. We were always proud to proclaim that Rangoon was a big city with a small town flavor. Now the population has grown to five million inhabitants, and unfortunately, the city has lost most of its old charm with daily traffic jams, and construction of new hotels, office buildings, etc. can be seen everywhere. However, many of the colonial-era buildings are still standing in the downtown area. Recently, there has been talk about demolishing these old buildings and constructing new luxury hotels in their place. I sincerely hope this will not happen as I feel that the younger generation should know about the country's heritage, i.e. as evidence of the past.

        Yangon is one of the safest cities in the world, but as in any other big city it always pays to be prudent. Having said that, even venturing out alone at night is not a problem, except you may get lost somewhere, but don't worry, there will be someone to help you find your way. Most people in the city speak English reasonably well, and many are eager to talk with foreigners. You may find the Buddhist monks to be the most enthusiastic when it comes to chatting with international travelers. And don't be surprised if some monks even invite you to visit their monasteries! By the way, Buddhist monks are forbidden to have any physical contact with women, so ladies beware!

        It is fairly easy to get around Yangon. Although local buses ply to all parts of the city, I wouldn't recommend them as taxis are plentiful and more comfortable. Unfortunately, they do not use meters, so be sure to agree on a fixed rate before taking any taxi. Remember, bargaining at small shops on the roadside is the norm, so polish up on your negotiating skills and you may end up getting a better deal than even the local folks, like it happened one time when my American friend managed to lower the price down even more than I did!
